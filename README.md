# Scikit-Learn Cluster Classifier
## Creator: Jay Mody

Using scikit API make_blob and keras, I created distinct number of clusters (number of classes) of data that I trained using a simple fully connected multilayer-perceptron network. 

**HOW TO RUN PROGRAM**

**1. Using anaconda, import the environment from environment.yml**

**2. Run classifier.py**

**3. Run tester.py**

After running the program, new plots should be generated under figs/
The trained model should be saved to saved_models/

###### Training Data
The training data consists of 4 distinct classes, made up from 100 data points.
